Analysing advanced performance metrics using publicly available data from
[fbref](https://fbref.com/en/squads/5bfb9659/2021-2022/Leeds-United-Stats) to 
detect causes and/or trends amongst clubs who suffered from "second season syndrome" in the Premier League VS those who had a strong second season based
on clubs who got promoted from 2016-17 and had at least two seasons in the league then.
